NEXT STEP: Sanitize all user form input before attempting to store to avoid SQL injection attack; hash user passwords before storage; provide remaining database functions to complete the UI/backend integration. SPRINT 3 REVIEW/RETROSPECTIVE: Accomplished user input sanitization through the use of Node pg package interface to PostgreSQL database. Added password hashing to app.js to secure passwords prior to storage on the database. Provided remaining SQL queries for app to store and retrieve information from the database, located inside app.js file. Uploaded new database schema into db/ directory, including updated UML diagram of final database design. All Sprint 3 goals were met. NEXT STEP: Continue expanding app capabilities and possibly redesign database for more efficiency in a deployed environment.

What went well for the team?
- Everyone completed their work on time and were extremely helpful if someone needed assistance.
- Team worked well together as we ran into problems and compromised and overcame them quickly to get a working demo running.
- Communicated better in sprint 3.

What might be impeding us from performing better?
- Busy/conflicting schedules
- setbacks of database construction. just waiting to get thinggs setup.

What can we do to improve?
- More accurate descriptions of work in progress to avoid duplicating efforts.
- set short time goals of one to two days of certain issues.
